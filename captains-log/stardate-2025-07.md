### Mission: Initialize Project Riker

Today marks the beginning of Project Riker. After extensive planning and design discussions, we've established:

1. **Core Architecture**: Plugin-based system with GitHub-centric management
2. **Key Technologies**: 
   - Promptflow for conversation management
   - Windmill for workflow automation
   - Plane for task tracking
   - LangChain/LlamaIndex hybrid for AI orchestration
3. **Mission Protocol**: All development tracked through GitHub Issues as "Away Missions"

The system is designed to build itself through conversational interaction. Number One will serve as the trusted executor of the Captain's vision.

**Status**: Repository initialized. Ready to begin implementation of core systems.

*"Make it so."*
