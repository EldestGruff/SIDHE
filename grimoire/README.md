# The Grimoire ðŸ“š

Welcome to the Grimoire - the sacred repository of all magical knowledge for SIDHE.

## What is the Grimoire?

The Grimoire contains detailed specifications, spell components, and arcane wisdom needed to enhance SIDHE's magical abilities. Think of it as the technical documentation, but written with more flair and mystical terminology.

## Structure

- **Spell Components** - Individual feature specifications
- **Incantation Guides** - API and interface documentation  
- **Magical Patterns** - Architecture and design patterns
- **Ancient Wisdom** - Best practices and lessons learned

## How to Use

Before embarking on any new quest, consult the relevant grimoire entries to understand:
- What magic needs to be woven
- How the spell components should interact
- What protective wards are required
- How success will be measured

## Adding New Knowledge

When you discover new magical techniques or complete a quest, update the grimoire with your findings. Future apprentices will thank you for your wisdom!

*May your spells compile cleanly and your tests pass on the first try.* âœ¨
