# Away Mission Brief: Workflow Generator Plugin

**Mission ID:** AWAY-008  
**Classification:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Mission Type:** Feature Implementation  
**Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks  

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objectives

Implement the Workflow Generator Plugin - an AI-powered system that transforms natural language descriptions into executable automation workflows, extending Riker's capabilities from understanding to action.

### Primary Objective
Create a plugin that converts conversational requests into structured, executable workflows using a YAML-based DSL, with full integration into the Conversation Engine.

### Secondary Objectives
- [ ] Design and implement workflow DSL with JSON schema validation
- [ ] Create LLM-based natural language to workflow parser
- [ ] Build workflow executor with rollback capabilities
- [ ] Develop template library for common patterns
- [ ] Implement workflow persistence and versioning
- [ ] Add dry-run and approval mechanisms for safety

## ðŸ“Š Mission Parameters

### Technical Requirements
- **Integration**: Message bus communication with Conversation Engine
- **Storage**: Redis-based workflow persistence
- **Validation**: JSON schema for workflow structure
- **Safety**: Dry-run mode, approval workflows, rollback support
- **Templates**: Pre-built patterns for common development tasks

### Workflow Capabilities
- Step-based execution with dependencies
- Conditional logic and loops
- Error handling and recovery
- Plugin action integration
- Variable substitution and templating
- Progress tracking and logging

## ðŸ”§ Technical Specifications

**Reference Documentation:** `/crew-quarters/workflow-generator-spec.md`  
**ADR Reference:** `ADR-011: Workflow Generator Architecture`

### Core Components
1. **Natural Language Parser** - Converts requests to workflow DSL
2. **Workflow Validator** - Ensures safety and correctness
3. **Workflow Executor** - Runs workflows with proper isolation
4. **Template Engine** - Manages reusable patterns
5. **Storage Manager** - Handles persistence and versioning

### Example Workflow DSL
```yaml
workflow:
  name: "Setup Python Project"
  version: "1.0"
  description: "Initialize a new Python project with best practices"
  
  inputs:
    - name: project_name
      type: string
      required: true
    - name: python_version
      type: string
      default: "3.11"
  
  steps:
    - id: create_structure
      type: command
      command: "mkdir -p ${project_name}/{src,tests,docs}"
      
    - id: init_git
      type: command
      command: "git init"
      working_dir: "${project_name}"
      
    - id: create_venv
      type: command
      command: "python${python_version} -m venv venv"
      working_dir: "${project_name}"
      
    - id: create_files
      type: template
      templates:
        - source: python_project_template
          target: "${project_name}"
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
- [ ] Conditional logic and loop support
- [ ] Error handling and rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Workflow composition and nesting
- [ ] Variable scoping and context management

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Week 4)
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite (90%+ coverage)
- [ ] Security hardening and input validation
- [ ] Performance optimization for large workflows
- [ ] Documentation and template library

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 85%+ accuracy in natural language to workflow conversion
- [ ] 99%+ reliability in workflow execution
- [ ] 20+ pre-built templates for common tasks
- [ ] Sub-second workflow validation
- [ ] Complete rollback capability for all operations

## ðŸ’¬ Captain's Notes

This plugin represents a major leap in Riker's capabilities - from understanding what needs to be done to actually doing it. The workflow generator should prioritize safety and clarity, always showing the user what will be executed before running it.

Key considerations:
- Workflows should be reviewable and editable before execution
- The system must prevent destructive operations without explicit approval
- Integration with existing plugins should feel seamless
- The natural language interface should handle ambiguity gracefully

The ultimate goal is to enable conversations like:
"Riker, set up a new React project with TypeScript, add testing with Jest, and configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD"

And have Riker respond with a complete, executable workflow that handles all the details.

## ðŸš€ Mission Resources

### Dependencies
- Anthropic Claude API for natural language processing
- PyYAML for workflow parsing
- jsonschema for validation
- Redis for persistence
- Jinja2 for templating

### Integration Points
- Conversation Engine (primary client)
- Memory Manager (context storage)
- GitHub Integration (workflow triggers)
- Config Manager (workflow configuration)
