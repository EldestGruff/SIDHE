# 🌟 The Great Transformation is Complete! 🌟

The project formerly known as "Riker" has been transformed through ancient magic into:

## SIDHE - Sentient Interactive Development Heuristic Engine

A mystical development assistant that helps weave code like fairy tales.

### ✨ What Changed?

- **Complete rebranding** from Star Trek to fairy tale theme
- **New terminology** that maintains all functionality  
- **Enhanced lore** connecting to Gruff Software's identity
- **The Old Laws** replace the Prime Directive
- **Quests** replace Away Missions
- **Grimoire** contains all wisdom (formerly crew-quarters)
- **Chronicle** records our journey (formerly captains-log)

### 🧙‍♂️ The Magic Continues...

All existing functionality remains intact. SIDHE stands ready to aid in your development quests!

#### Core Magical Systems:
- **Quest Tracker** (GitHub Integration) - Manages your development quests
- **Tome Keeper** (Memory Manager) - Remembers all conversations  
- **Voice of Wisdom** (Conversation Engine) - Provides intelligent responses
- **Spell Weaver** (Workflow Generator) - Creates automation enchantments

#### New Terminology Guide:
- **Archmage** - Project leader (formerly Captain)
- **Quest** - Development task (formerly Away Mission)
- **Grimoire** - Documentation (formerly crew-quarters)

### 🌟 Why the Transformation?

This change eliminates copyright concerns while embracing our identity as **Gruff Software** - creators of whimsical yet powerful development tools. The fairy tale theme reflects our belief that coding should be magical, not mundane.
