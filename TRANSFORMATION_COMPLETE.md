# üåü The Great Transformation is Complete! üåü

The project formerly known as "Riker" has been transformed through ancient magic into:

## SIDHE - Sentient Interactive Development Heuristic Engine

A mystical development assistant that helps weave code like fairy tales.

### ‚ú® What Changed?

- **Complete rebranding** from Star Trek to fairy tale theme
- **New terminology** that maintains all functionality  
- **Enhanced lore** connecting to Gruff Software's identity
- **The Old Laws** replace the Prime Directive
- **Quests** replace Away Missions
- **Grimoire** contains all wisdom (formerly crew-quarters)
- **Chronicle** records our journey (formerly captains-log)

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Magic Continues...

All existing functionality remains intact. SIDHE stands ready to aid in your development quests!

#### Core Magical Systems:
- **Quest Tracker** (GitHub Integration) - Manages your development quests
- **Tome Keeper** (Memory Manager) - Remembers all conversations  
- **Voice of Wisdom** (Conversation Engine) - Provides intelligent responses
- **Spell Weaver** (Workflow Generator) - Creates automation enchantments

#### New Terminology Guide:
- **Archmage** - Project leader (formerly Captain)
- **Quest** - Development task (formerly Away Mission)
- **Grimoire** - Documentation (formerly crew-quarters)
- **Chronicle** - Project history (formerly captains-log)
- **Enchantment** - Deployment/implementation
- **Wards** - Security measures
- **Spellcraft** - Technical architecture

### üåü Why the Transformation?

This change eliminates copyright concerns while embracing our identity as **Gruff Software** - creators of whimsical yet powerful development tools. The fairy tale theme reflects our belief that coding should be magical, not mundane.

## üó°Ô∏è Quest #8: Workflow Generator Plugin

**Quest ID**: QUEST-008  
**Classification**: üî¥ Critical  
**Quest Type**: Feature Implementation  
**Estimated Duration**: 4 weeks

### üéØ Quest Objectives
Implement the Workflow Generator Plugin - an AI-powered system that transforms natural language descriptions into executable automation workflows, extending SIDHE's capabilities from understanding to action.

**Primary Objective**  
Create a plugin that converts conversational requests into structured, executable workflows using a YAML-based DSL, with full integration into the Conversation Engine.

**Secondary Objectives**
- Design and implement workflow DSL with JSON schema validation
- Create LLM-based natural language to workflow parser
- Build workflow executor with rollback capabilities
- Develop template library for common patterns
- Implement workflow persistence and versioning
- Add dry-run and approval mechanisms for safety

### üìä Quest Parameters
**Technical Requirements**
- Integration: Message bus communication with Conversation Engine
- Storage: Redis-based workflow persistence
- Validation: JSON schema for workflow structure
- Safety: Dry-run mode, approval workflows, rollback support
- Templates: Pre-built patterns for common development tasks

**Workflow Capabilities**
- Step-based execution with dependencies
- Conditional logic and loops
- Error handling and recovery
- Plugin action integration
- Variable substitution and templating
- Progress tracking and logging

### üîß Technical Specifications
**Reference Documentation**: /grimoire/workflow-generator-spec.md  
**ADR Reference**: ADR-011: Workflow Generator Architecture

**Core Components**
- Natural Language Parser - Converts requests to workflow DSL
- Workflow Validator - Ensures safety and correctness
- Workflow Executor - Runs workflows with proper isolation
- Template Engine - Manages reusable patterns
- Storage Manager - Handles persistence and versioning

**Example Workflow DSL**
```yaml
workflow:
  name: "Setup Python Project"
  version: "1.0"
  description: "Initialize a new Python project with best practices"
  
  inputs:
    - name: project_name
      type: string
      required: true
    - name: python_version
      type: string
      default: "3.11"
  
  steps:
    - id: create_structure
      type: command
      command: "mkdir -p ${project_name}/{src,tests,docs}"
      
    - id: init_git
      type: command
      command: "git init"
      working_dir: "${project_name}"
      
    - id: create_venv
      type: command
      command: "python${python_version} -m venv venv"
      working_dir: "${project_name}"
      
    - id: create_files
      type: template
      templates:
        - source: python_project_template
          target: "${project_name}"
```

### üìã Acceptance Criteria
**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)**
- Workflow DSL parser and validator implemented
- Basic executor with step sequencing
- Redis storage integration
- Unit tests for all core components

**Phase 2: Natural Language Integration (Week 2)**
- LLM-based workflow generation from text
- Integration with Conversation Engine via message bus
- Template matching and suggestion system
- Clarification dialog for ambiguous requests

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)**
- Conditional logic and loop support
- Error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Workflow composition and nesting
- Variable scoping and context management

**Phase 4: Production Readiness (Week 4)**
- Comprehensive test suite (90%+ coverage)
- Security hardening and input validation
- Performance optimization for large workflows
- Documentation and template library

**Success Metrics**
- 85%+ accuracy in natural language to workflow conversion
- 99%+ reliability in workflow execution
- 20+ pre-built templates for common tasks
- Sub-second workflow validation
- Complete rollback capability for all operations

### üí¨ Archmage's Notes
This plugin represents a major leap in SIDHE's capabilities - from understanding what needs to be done to actually doing it. The workflow generator should prioritize safety and clarity, always showing the user what will be executed before running it.

**Key considerations:**
- Workflows should be reviewable and editable before execution
- The system must prevent destructive operations without explicit approval
- Integration with existing plugins should feel seamless
- The natural language interface should handle ambiguity gracefully

The ultimate goal is to enable conversations like:
*"SIDHE, set up a new React project with TypeScript, add testing with Jest, and configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD"*

And have SIDHE respond with a complete, executable workflow that handles all the details.

### üöÄ Quest Resources
**Dependencies**
- Anthropic Claude API for natural language processing
- PyYAML for workflow parsing
- jsonschema for validation
- Redis for persistence
- Jinja2 for templating

**Integration Points**
- Conversation Engine (primary client)
- Memory Manager (context storage)
- GitHub Integration (workflow triggers)
- Config Manager (workflow configuration)

**Quest Status**: üü¢ Ready for Implementation  
**Assigned to**: Claude (Implementation AI)  
**Start Command**: `./scripts/implement-quest.sh 8`
