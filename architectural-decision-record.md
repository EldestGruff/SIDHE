**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ APPROVED & PROVEN  
**Participants:** Archmage Andy, Chief Engineer Ivy  

### Context
SIDHE requires a scalable, extensible architecture that supports both AI-powered conversation capabilities and specialized functionality through modular components.

### Decision
- **Plugin Location**: `src/plugins/` for all specialized functionality
- **Plugin Pattern**: Each plugin is self-contained with standardized interfaces
- **Plugin Communication**: Message bus architecture for loose coupling
- **Core Components**: Separate from plugins, handle orchestration and core functionality

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Clear separation of concerns, extensible architecture
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Plugins can be developed independently
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Easy to add/remove functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk**: Additional complexity in inter-plugin communication
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk**: Need standardized plugin interfaces

### Current Implementation Status

## ADR-002: Conversation Engine as Main Application

**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ APPROVED  
**Participants:** Archmage Andy, Chief Engineer Ivy  

### Context
The Conversation Engine serves as SIDHE's "brain" - the central orchestrator that needs to coordinate all other components and plugins.

### Decision
- **Location**: `src/voice_of_wisdom/` (NOT in `src/plugins/`)
- **Role**: Main application and central orchestrator
- **Responsibility**: Plugin coordination, conversation management, intent parsing
- **Architecture**: Standalone application that communicates with plugins

### Rationale

- Should have direct access to core system resources
- Serves as the primary entry point for user interactions

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Clear architectural hierarchy
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Central point of control and coordination
- ‚úÖ **Positive**: Simplified enchantment of core functionality

```json
{
  "id": "unique-message-id",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
  "source": "plugin-name",
  "target": "plugin-name|broadcast",
  "type": "command|query|response|event",
  "data": {},
  "correlation_id": "optional-request-correlation"
}
```

## ADR-023: Session Protocol System (FairyCircle)

**Date:** July 5, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
**Participants:** Archmage Andy, Chief Engineer Ivy  

### Context
AI-driven development faces a fundamental challenge: each conversation starts without context of the project's current state, recent decisions, or active work. This creates inconsistency, duplicated effort, and loss of architectural knowledge between development sessions.

### Decision
**Session Protocol System**: Implement comprehensive session management through the `FairyCircle` class to ensure every AI conversation begins with complete project context and maintains consistent development protocols.

#### Core Implementation Features

**Project State Persistence**:
- Active/completed/blocked quest tracking
- Plugin status monitoring (Memory Manager, GitHub Integration, Config Manager, Conversation Engine)
- Recent architectural decisions tracking
- Current focus area maintenance

**Session Lifecycle Management**:
```python
class FairyCircle:
    def initialize(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Load complete project context for new conversations"""
    
    def add_accomplishment(self, description: str, quest_id: Optional[str] = None):
        """Record session accomplishments with quest linking"""
    
    def add_decision(self, decision: str, context: Optional[str] = None):
        """Track architectural decisions made during session"""
    
    def update_quest_status(self, quest_id: str, status: QuestStatus, notes: str):
        """Update quest progress with detailed tracking"""
    
    def complete(self, summary: str, next_focus: Optional[str] = None) -> SessionSummary:
        """Complete session with comprehensive documentation updates"""
```

**Documentation Automation**:
- Automatic chronicle (stardate) entries with timestamped progress
- Bridge/Sanctum status document updates for quick project overview
- ADR updates when architectural decisions are made
- Project state serialization for consistent handoffs

**Architectural Constraint Validation**:
- Real-time validation of proposed changes against established constraints
- Authority boundary checking (Strategic vs Implementation decisions)
- Automatic escalation warnings for constraint violations
- Reference linking to relevant ADRs and architectural decisions

#### Session Template Generation
```python
def create_session_template() -> str:
    """Generate initialization prompt for new AI conversations"""
    return """
    # SIDHE Development Session - Initialization Protocol
    
    from session_protocol import FairyCircle
    session = FairyCircle()
    context = session.initialize()
    
    # Display current project context loaded
    """
```

### Rationale
- **Consistency**: Every AI conversation begins with identical project context
- **Continuity**: No loss of progress or decisions between sessions
- **Efficiency**: Eliminates time spent re-explaining project state
- **Quality**: Maintains architectural integrity through constraint validation
- **Documentation**: Automatic maintenance of project records and progress tracking
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple AI agents working on different aspects simultaneously

### Consequences
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**: Complete session protocol system operational
- ‚úÖ **PROVEN**: Successfully maintains project consistency across multiple development sessions
- ‚úÖ **POSITIVE**: Dramatic reduction in context-setting time for new conversations
- ‚úÖ **POSITIVE**: Automatic documentation maintenance eliminates manual tracking overhead
- ‚úÖ **POSITIVE**: Architectural constraint validation prevents accidental violations
- ‚úÖ **POSITIVE**: Session summaries provide excellent project progress visibility
- ‚úÖ **POSITIVE**: Template generation enables immediate AI onboarding
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPENDENCY**: Requires disciplined use of session protocol by all AI agents
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MAINTENANCE**: Project state schema requires updates as system evolves

### Strategic Impact
- **Development Velocity**: Eliminates context-setting overhead from AI conversations
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in architectural constraint validation
- **Knowledge Management**: Comprehensive automatic documentation of all decisions and progress
- **Team Scalability**: Multiple AI agents can work consistently with shared context
- **Project Visibility**: Clear tracking of accomplishments, decisions, and focus areas

### Implementation Files
- `scripts/session_protocol.py`: Complete FairyCircle implementation (500+ lines)
- `chronicle/`: Automatic session logging with stardate format
- `BRIDGE.md`: Auto-updated project status document
- `architectural-constraints.md`: Constraint validation rules
