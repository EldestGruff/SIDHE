# ADR-011: Workflow Generator Architecture

**Date:** July 6, 2025  
**Status:** üü° PROPOSED  
**Participants:** Captain Andy, Chief Engineer Ivy  

## Context

With the Conversation Engine complete, Riker can understand natural language requests but lacks the ability to transform those requests into executable workflows. The Workflow Generator will bridge this gap by creating automated sequences of actions from conversational descriptions.

## Decision

### Architecture Overview
- **Plugin Location**: `src/plugins/workflow_generator/`
- **Workflow Representation**: YAML-based DSL with JSON schema validation
- **Execution Model**: Step-based with rollback capabilities
- **Integration**: Via message bus with Conversation Engine as primary client

### Workflow DSL Structure
```yaml
workflow:
  name: "Deploy React Application"
  version: "1.0"
  description: "Complete deployment pipeline for React apps"
  
  inputs:
    - name: app_name
      type: string
      required: true
    - name: environment
      type: enum
      values: [development, staging, production]
      default: development
  
  steps:
    - id: build
      type: command
      command: "npm run build"
      working_dir: "${app_name}"
      
    - id: test
      type: command
      command: "npm test"
      on_failure: abort
      
    - id: deploy
      type: plugin_action
      plugin: deployment_manager
      action: deploy
      params:
        source: "./build"
        target: "${environment}"
```

### Key Components
1. **Workflow Parser**: Converts natural language to workflow DSL
2. **Workflow Validator**: Ensures workflow integrity and safety
3. **Workflow Executor**: Runs workflows with proper error handling
4. **Workflow Store**: Persists and retrieves workflow definitions
5. **Template Library**: Pre-built workflow patterns

## Rationale

- **YAML DSL**: Human-readable, version-controllable, widely understood
- **Step-based Execution**: Clear progress tracking and error recovery
- **Plugin Integration**: Leverages existing capabilities without duplication
- **Natural Language Input**: Seamless integration with Conversation Engine
- **Template System**: Accelerates common tasks while allowing customization

## Consequences

### Positive
- ‚úÖ Transforms conversations into actionable automation
- ‚úÖ Reusable workflow definitions
- ‚úÖ Clear execution model with rollback support
- ‚úÖ Extensible through plugin actions
- ‚úÖ Version control friendly format

### Negative
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional complexity in natural language parsing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need for comprehensive validation to ensure safety
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential for workflow explosion without proper management

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Destructive workflows could cause damage
  - **Mitigation**: Dry-run mode, approval requirements for production
- **Risk**: Complex workflows become unmaintainable
  - **Mitigation**: Workflow composition and modular design
- **Risk**: Natural language ambiguity
  - **Mitigation**: Clarification dialogs and preview before execution

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
- Workflow DSL definition and parser
- Basic validator and executor
- Redis-based workflow store

### Phase 2: Natural Language Integration (Week 2)
- LLM-based workflow generation
- Integration with Conversation Engine
- Template matching system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)
- Conditional logic and loops
- Error handling and rollback
- Workflow composition

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Week 4)
- Comprehensive testing
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization

## Success Metrics
- Generate accurate workflows from natural language 85%+ of the time
- Execute workflows with 99%+ reliability
- Support 20+ common development patterns in template library
- Sub-second workflow validation
- Complete rollback capability for all workflows

## Future Considerations
- Visual workflow editor integration
- Workflow marketplace for sharing
- Advanced scheduling and triggers
- Multi-environment workflow management
- AI-powered workflow optimization
